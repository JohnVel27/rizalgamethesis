Justiano: You are the new student from Calamba, are you not?
Rizal: Yes, Maestro. My name is José Rizal
Justiano: Why have you come to Biñan to study?
Narrator: Some boys glanced at him curiously. He was smaller than most, yet his voice was steady.
Justiano: Many boys come here with the same words. Few remain when the lessons become difficult.
Justiano: I will not give up, Maestro.
Narrator: The teacher studied the boy’s face, searching for doubt — but saw none.
Justiano: If you wish to remain, you must prove your effort. Tell me — why is education important?
Rizal: Education helps us understand the world… and teaches us how to think, judge wisely, and improve ourselves.
Narrator: A murmur passed through the classroom. Few boys spoke with such clarity.
Justiano: Hmm. A thoughtful answer.
Justiano: Answer this\: If there are four groups of three, how many are there in all?
Justiano: You may answer Jose.
Rizal: Twelve, Maestro.
Justiano: Correct.
classmates: He answered quickly…
classmates: Perhaps he studied before coming here.
Narrator: José kept his eyes forward, refusing to be distracted.
Justiano: Repeat after me\: “Buenos días.”
classmates: Buenos días.
Justiano: What does it mean?
Rizal: It means “Good morning,” Maestro.
Justiano: You learn quickly.
Narrator: Though praise was rare, the class noticed.
Justiano: José, intelligence alone is not enough. What must a student possess to succeed?
Rizal: Discipline, respect, and perseverance, Maestro.
Justiano: Very good.
Justiano: Remember this\: A sharp mind is useless without discipline. Knowledge without character is dangerous.
Narrator: The boys listened carefully. Even the restless ones sat still.
Justiano: If you continue to work hard, you will succeed in this school.
Rizal: Thank you, Maestro. I will do my best.
