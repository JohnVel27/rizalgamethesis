Rizal: Yes, Mother! I want to learn more.
Teodora: You are always eager. Very well. But first — tell me the alphabet.
Rizal: This is a story about a young moth and his mother.
Rizal: What is a moth, Mother?
Teodora: A moth is a small insect that flies at night. They are often attracted to light.
Rizal: Like the lamp beside us?
Teodora: Yes, just like this lamp.
Narrator: The Story Begins
Teodora: One night, a mother moth and her son were flying in the dark. Then they saw a bright and beautiful flame.
Rizal: Was it very bright?
Teodora: Yes, it was shining strongly. The young moth had never seen something so beautiful before.
Rizal: What did he think it was?
Teodora: He thought it was the sun.
Rizal: But the sun only appears in the morning.
Teodora: That is true. But the young moth did not know that.
Narrator: The Warning
Teodora: The mother moth said, 'Do not go near that light. It is not the sun. It is dangerous.
Rizal: Why was it dangerous?
Teodora: Because it was fire. And fire can burn.
Rizal: Did the young moth believe his mother?
Teodora: He heard her… but he did not listen.
Teodora: The young moth was curious. He wanted to see the beautiful light up close.
Rizal: Was he brave?
Teodora: He thought he was brave. But sometimes, bravery without wisdom can be dangerous.
Rizal: What happened then?
Teodora: He flew closer… and closer… until the flame burned his wings.
Rizal: Did he die?
Teodora: Yes, my son. The flame consumed him.
Narrator: The Lesson
Teodora: My child, remember this\: Not all bright things are good. And not all dangers look frightening.
Rizal: I do not know, Mother…
Teodora: That is something you must learn as you grow. There are times when you must be careful. But there may also be times when you must stand for what is right—even if it is dangerous
Narrator: José did not fully understand it yet. But deep in his heart, the story of the moth began to mean something more. Outside their peaceful home, injustice was growing. And one day, José would choose to face a different kind of flame.
Narrator: Now, Player, let’s see how much you learned from the story of the moth. Answer carefully!
