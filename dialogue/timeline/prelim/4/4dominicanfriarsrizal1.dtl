\dominicanfriars: Rizal, your essays show promise, but remember,  colonial institutions have strict rules and traditions. Follow them carefully, or you will face consequences. Merit alone will not protect you here.
Rizal: Why do they treat me differently than the Spanish students? I work just as hard, yet their words feel sharp… almost as if my effort is never enough. I must learn, but also be careful.
classmates: José, do not be discouraged. Some of the friars do not trust Filipino students. They expect mistakes even when you do everything right.
Rizal: I understand… but I will not stop learning. I must continue my studies, observe closely, and understand why this happens. Knowledge alone is not enough; one must see the truth behind the rules and remain steadfast in purpose.
classmates: You have courage, José. Many would give up under this kind of scrutiny.
Rizal: Courage is not enough; I need patience, discipline, and wisdom. I will prove that our people can excel, even under unfair circumstances, and use this knowledge to make a difference one day.
Narrator: In that moment, José realized that learning at UST was more than studying books. He was observing the inequalities of the system, noting the subtle prejudices, and preparing himself to navigate a world that demanded not only intellect but resilience and courage.
