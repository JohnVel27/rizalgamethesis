Narrator: In 1877, José Rizal enrolled at the University of Santo Tomas to study Philosophy and Letters. The campus was large, with high walls and expansive lecture halls that reflected centuries of tradition. The formal environment impressed José, but he soon noticed it lacked the warmth of his previous school, Ateneo
Narrator: The professors at UST were strict, often demanding rote memorization and unquestioning obedience. Some Dominican friars showed favoritism toward Spanish students, making Filipino students feel unwelcome. José quietly observed these biases, determined not to let them hinder his learning.
Narrator: Despite the rigid atmosphere, José continued to excel academically. He studied diligently, completing assignments with precision and thoughtfulness. His love for learning remained strong, even in a setting that often seemed cold and impersonal.
Narrator: Outside the classroom, José discussed his experiences with his Filipino classmates. They shared stories of prejudice and discrimination, which made José aware of the broader inequalities in colonial institutions. These conversations shaped his understanding of social injustice beyond academics.
Narrator: At home, José received guidance and encouragement from his mother, Teodora, and his brother, Francisco. They reminded him that knowledge was a tool to challenge unfairness and to uplift his fellow countrymen. Inspired by their advice, José resolved to persevere and use his education wisely
Narrator: Over time, José realized that UST’s teaching style and the pervasive prejudice limited his growth as a scholar and thinker. To continue learning in an environment that respected merit and creativity, he decided to leave UST and pursue further studies abroad. This bold decision marked the beginning of a new chapter in his journey toward knowledge, justice, and self-discovery.
